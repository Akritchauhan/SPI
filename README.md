# SPI
This Verilog module implements a simple SPI Master Transmitter that sends a 12-bit data frame (din) over the MOSI line using a generated serial clock (sclk). The module operates as a synchronous state-machine and includes automatic chip-select control and a done flag indicating the completion of transmission.
